## Basic Pizza Dough

### Ingredients
- 2 envelopes (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast (not rapid-rise) 
- 2 tbsp sugar 
- 1/4 C extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for bowl and brushing 
- 2 tsp kosher salt 
- 4 C unbleached all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled), plus more for dusting

### Instructions
1. Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle with yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

2. Whisk sugar, oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Add flour and stir until a sticky dough forms. Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and brush top with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 1 or 2 times before using.

#### Notes
- To make a more flavorful pizza dough, skip the rise and transfer the dough to an oiled, sealable container. Close tightly and let it cold ferment in the fridge for 3-5 days. It will give the dough a subtle soughdough-like flavor.
